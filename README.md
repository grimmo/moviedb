MovieDb
=======

This is my personal movie database to keep track of movies I've seen or not seen but
most importantly where I did store them: Are they in the living room? Or in the
computer one? Which box or case are they in and what color is it? Do I have
a blu-ray version of this movie or just a dvd one or both? This kind of stuff.

This project was initally started in Django and then migrated to web2py 2.x

Movie details are fetched from themoviedb.org, you will need an API key.

I've just started an experimental branch to keep track of tv series, data
will come from thetvdb.com but this is in early alpha stage.
